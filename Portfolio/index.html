        <section>
            <p>I am a third year student at the University of Illinois studying Computer Science and Anthropology. I am a proud Air Force ROTC cadet at <a href="http://publish.illinois.edu/afrotc/">Detachment 190</a>,
                and a member of <a href="https://www-s.acm.illinois.edu/webmonkeys/2012/">WebMonkeys</a>, our schools web development group. We recently hosted a "Code in the Dark" competetion, where participants 
                were given 20 minutes to replicate a website. The main catch being participants cannot open or use their browser to view their progress. It was a successful event and it's always fun hanging out with like-minded people, talking shop!
            </p>
            <p>Currently, I am focusing on web development, but I am not opposed to mobile or game development. I currently code mainly in HTML, CSS, C/C++ and am learning JavaScript. I plan on picking up React for front end development, Node.js for backend, and eventually SQL for databases. Stay tuned for a small series of blogs and guides I plan on posting!</p>

        <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>My mantra is to be sound in <em>Mind, Body, and Soul</em>; all three are interlinked and are necessary to become the strongest version of yourself.</li>
            <li>The Golden Rule, treat others how they would want you to treat them. Everyone requires different needs, attention, enouragement, counseling, etc... you cannot use a one-size fits all approach.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Goals</h2>

        <h2>Skills + Project Pathway</h2>
        <p>The order I plan on learning and applying new skills:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>DOM JavaScript</li>
            <li>Build a text based game (browser or terminal based)</li>
            <li>Build something with my QualComm Dragon Board (I miss playing with hardware)</li>
            <li></li>
        </ol>

        <h2>How I spend my free time</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cooking:</strong> my love for cooking stems from my Granny and has only grown overtime. It even extends outside of the kitchen to historical and cultural concepts of food such as "Soul Food Sundays" or the "Chicago Dog" are fascinating. </li>
            <li><strong>Exercise:</strong> going hand-in-hand with cooking, I live an active lifestyle. Weightlifting, basketball, High Intensity Interval Training, Air Force ROTC physical training... I read lots of blogs and watch videos on different techniques, recovery methods, nutrition, and more.</li>
            <li><strong>Reading:</strong> this is mostly saved for breaks since the school year is so busy, but I read fiction, fantasy, and guides. Currently reading <i>Sundown Towns: A Hidden Dimension of American Racism</i> by Dr. James W. Loewen, and <i>King</i>by one of my favorite fitness YouTubers Elliot Hulse.</li>
            <li><strong>Coding:</strong> ok maybe this is implied, but it's just so fun! Solving tough algorithms, learning about different data structures, computer architecture and how huge of an impact it has on software, mountains of web technologies, the list is forever everygrowing.
            And that's one of the things I enjoy most about development: <u>you're never done learning.</u></li>
        </ul>
